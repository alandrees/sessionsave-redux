SessionSave pidgin plugin
====================

To install, you need a working pidgin source tree (meaning, you have to have
compiled pidgin from source).

Now, edit the Makefile that came with SessionSave, and change the topmost
line:

PIDGIN_SRCDIR=/bla/bla/bla

to the paths to your pidgin source tree (where you compiled pidgin).  You might
have to change the PIDGIN_INSTALLPREFIX as well, but hopefully not.

If you are compiling on a Windows machine, make sure PLATFORM=win32 is
uncommented. Otherwise, make sure it is commented.

Become root, and type 'make'.  SessionSave should compile and install to the
plugin directory.

Restart pidgin, and open the Preferences dialog.   Load the SessionSave plugin
in the Plugin tab.  That's it!
